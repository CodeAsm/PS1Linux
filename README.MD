# Linux for the Playstation 1

Ongoing project to bring Linux back to the sony Playstation 1, One.
Based on the original work by the wonderfull rusian Runix team.

## Plans

Reverseengineer or atleast figure out how they intended to store a filesystem on the memoryunits.
change the videodriver a bit.
figure out how to connect their usb host ic to the PIO.

## How to

Tobedone, its not realy that hard when you got the right tool to convert the elf kernel into PS-EXE.
Can be compiled on a x86_64 host using crosscompilers.
